# Telegram-bot-IA
A telegram bot that gets an image and returns the objects detected with the restb.ai api

## IMPORTANT
You need to sign in on [Imgur official webpage](https://imgur.com/) and paste your **client_id**, **client_secret**, **username** and **password** into the **auth.ini** file located into *src/* or the images won't upload anywhere to be processed by restb.ai IA.

To control your own bot you must read about **BotFather** that is a kind of 'bot generator'.
Paste the bot token that BotFather gives you when the bot is created in **auth.ini**.


**Happy coding!**
